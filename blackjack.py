#The possible card values range from 1 to 10 and, unlike a real deck, the
# probability of drawing a card is equal
#The game begins by dealing two visible cards to the player (face up), and two
#cards to the dealer. However, in the case of the dealer, one card is visible
#to other players while the other is hidden.
#The player decides whether to "hit" (draw another card), or "stand" which ends
#their turn.
#The player may hit any number of times. Should the total of the cards exceed
#21, the player "busts" and loses the game to the dealer.


#hit draws a new card
#stand ends the players tur
#randomize players first 2 draws(range from 1 to 10)
#randomize dealers first 2 draws (range from 1 to 10).  The second card remins
#hidden until the player stands or reaches 21
#At this point the dealer revels the hidden card
#The dealer must hit if the total is 16 or less, and must standÂ if the value is
#17 or more
#The dealer wins all ties (i.e. if both the dealer and the player reach 21, the
#dealer wins)
#The program indicates who the winner is and asks to play again

#if the total exceeds 21 the player busts and loses the game
